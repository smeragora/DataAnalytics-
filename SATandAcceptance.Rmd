When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

library(plyr)
#open both csv files, and make sure they are not strings and the heading is on.
#use cbind to combine both data frames 
SATvsAcceptance<-cbind(SATUSA,AcceptanceData)

#After using cbind a few columns repeat, so subtract them off 
SATvsAcceptance<-SATvsAcceptance[,-(8:10)]

#because your numbers are read as scripts used the function as numerical so they can be read as numerical
#add the 75th percentiles of both cr and math to get the desired SAT score. This vector will become a new column
SATvsAcceptance$TotalSAT75<-as.numeric(SATvsAcceptance$sat_math_75)+as.numeric(SATvsAcceptance$sat_cr_75)

#to find the acceptance make sure the computer reads your number as numercal, so use the as.numerical function again.
#after do 100(addmited / applies) to get the acceptance rate and create a new vector that will be a new column. 
SATvsAcceptance$acceptancerate<-100*(as.numeric(SATvsAcceptance$admissions_total)/as.numeric(SATvsAcceptance$applicants_total))

#next I seperated the data by years. To find how many years they are and what they are I used the unique function.
#I subsetted them and created 1 new data frame for each year.
unique(SATvsAcceptance$year)
SAT_2014<-subset(SATvsAcceptance, SATvsAcceptance$year==2014)
SAT_2015<-subset(SATvsAcceptance, SATvsAcceptance$year==2015)
SAT_2016<-subset(SATvsAcceptance, SATvsAcceptance$year==2016)

# I found the correleation for each year after plotting them. The correlation was on the weaker side. 
# When looking at the plot you can see there are two different trends. There is almost no trend from 200 to 1350.They were all around -.4
#There is a negetive correlation trend seen at 1350 to 1600.

#going back to the very first data frame I made, I am looking at all the unique colleges to find the average SAT and the 75 perctile and the average acceptance rate.
#by finding the unique college names we see how many times the loop function has to implement
u<-as.character(unique(SATvsAcceptance$university_name))
#empty data frame so we can later add university name, average SAT", average Acceptance Rate
answer<-matrix(0, nrow = length(u), ncol=3)
answer<-data.frame(answer)
colnames(answer)<-c("university name", "average SAT", "Ave Acceptance Rate")
#for loop is used to go through every college. The index is added by one wo it can keep going to the next college
#x starts at one so that the first college is started with. It is the starting point. 
x=1
for(i in 1:length(u)){
  temp<-subset(SATvsAcceptance, SATvsAcceptance$university_name ==u[i])
  answer$`university name`[x]<-u[i]
  answer$`average SAT`[x]<-mean(temp$TotalSAT75)
  answer$`Ave Acceptance Rate`[x]<-mean(temp$acceptancerate)
  x<-x+1

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
